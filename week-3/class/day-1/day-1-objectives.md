6. Assessment 1 practice and assessment
7. Break

10. Recap and Q&A

What did you learn today?

1. int y = x++; - y will be original x value, x will update
2. ++x; update x, and use that value
3. switch - comparing multiple cases for single variable
   1. break; - stops execution of switch
   2. switch(expression) { case 1, 2: //thing to do break; default: //handles if all cases are false}
4. try and catch(Exception e) - handles exceptions 
   1. e.printStackTrace()
5. IO - input output 
6. FileInputStream(path)
   1. Path starts in root directory of project
7. Scanner.close() - ends process of scanning input, input either user or file
8. scanner.hasNextLine() - checks if next line exists
9. String newString = new String("string");
10. continue;
