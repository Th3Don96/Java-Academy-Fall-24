What did you learn yesterday?

1. getters and setters
2. this.stuff
3. Object - represents real life entities
4. OOP - Object Oriented Programming
   1. classes - defines object - Blueprint, objects made from blueprint
      1. class names are written in UpperCamelCase
      2. setters are used to set
      3. getters are used to get values
         1. takes no params
   2. this - refers to instance
   3. constructor method
      1. Method to initiate objects by setting initial values
      2. has to have same name as class it's in
      3. May or may not need parameters
   4. instantiate object from class with new
   5. instance variables/fields declared at class level
5. Declaring more than one variable with same data type using comma
   1. EX. String val1, val2, val3
6. Encapsulation
   1. Access specifiers 
      1. private - not accessible outside instance
      2. public - is accessible outside instance
      3. protected
   2. Default access specifier is package-private
7. Be explicit with everything
8. static v non-static methods and variables
9. Auto-gen
   1. Generator
      1. to generate getters/setters/constructor/etc
10. Parse - converting one type to another
